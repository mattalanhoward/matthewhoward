The purpose of this project is to create a personal homepage.  The goal is for this project to serve as a portfolio and possibly be split off into a personal site.

index.html
    This is a basic landing page with a navbar, header, photo, paragraph and footer.  I chose to use 'font awesome' icons as practice and also made a working email icon.  This page links to my personal youtube, instagram and github accounts. 

portfolio.html
    This includes a list of projects I have worked on.
        Musicon emphasized use of handlebars.
        Chore Door is a guessing game utilizing js.
        Tea Cozy is a basic html/css site working with flexbox. 

gallery.html
    Used handlebars to loop through object to populate page. 
    There is also a link to stats.html here.

stats.html
    This page is used mainly to fullfil the requirements of the project.
    A table with sort functions is included.
    A meaningless list is also added. 
    Bootstrap is used for the buttons and the positioning of the buttons.

    This is main style sheet

scssStyle.scss
    This file was created for the project to use Sass.  All of the styles are applied to the stats.html file.
